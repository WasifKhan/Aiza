Dear Diary,

Nov 6th, 2015
As this is the first post, may as well describe where my life currently is.

It’s nov 6th, I’m working full time at blackberry, just submitted my application for master's degree at UW for AI - really hoping I get in. May do it at WLU if not...but I do want a masters in AI so I can go into programming AI and eventually into lecturing.

My strengths are in my empathy and focus. my weaknesses are my impulsivity and lack of connection with others. I feel like I still like Mia, but I’m not sure. I’ve thought about her so much now that I’m not sure if I’m just tired of thinking about her, or really want her. I do acknowledge it is unhealthy how I obsess over her...but I’m also not sure what to do to get over it.

I’m smoking a lot of weed right now, even though I keep telling myself I’ll quit (impulsivity). Really hoping today is the last day...but I’ve said that for the past month.

I just got word a few hours ago that I got accepted into my master's degree. This feels amazing, lots of doors to be opened with this. i still play with my hair all the time, as well as smoke weed way too much...though I feel I will eventually stop this… i’m slowly getting fed up with not being able to hold myself to a goal.

Mia told me recently she can’t consider us to be friends anymore because of all the shit I put her through. I can’t believe this is how she feels. I really thought we shared something special. Though I have learned a very important lesson from this.

NEVER assume you’re relationship with someone. Always clarify expectations and be on the same page. I made the mistake of doing tons of pleasantries for Mia, assuming this would build our friendship. This was wrong. Remember that you do nice things because of who you are, not because you expect things in return...I guess I didn’t expect anything in return, it's just hurtful to know she felt the way she did after all the pleasantries. 

She has a lot of problems to fix as well. I fell for her because I wanted to ‘teach’ her the correct way of living because she is retarded when it comes to making healthy decisions. This is not the right way to go about it. It may be correct in marriage, but in a relationship - you must let the other person do what they want. Trying to control their behaviour will only result in them pushing you away.

Wow it's been awhile since i’ve written in here. I guess it's because the past few months have been quite tough. Still thinking about Mia, even starting to think about Shraddha. Though I’ve started to really internalize the fact that it's a problem with me. I don’t really know what it is...I for some reason desperately want a girlfriend, or intimacy, or something along those lines. 

I’m bored beyond belief. I’m not motivated by anything anymore. Maybe its because I’m smoking too much weed, but maybe its because I can now truly differentiate passion and interest. I desperately want to stop smoking weed and stick to a schedule...but it’s so hard. I always tell myself I’m going to stick to it, but barely ever start, let alone go a few days. I feel like my depression/anxiety has started to calm down, I’m not sure...I could be completely wrong. I really feel like tomorrow I will start a reasonable schedule that i’ll actually stick with. Mainly because I’m finally starting to see there’s nothing I’m spending my time on...which in a weird way is making me motivated to do the things I know I’m going to have to do on a regular basis for the rest of my life...like workout, meditate, read, healthy habits. 

I’ve started to doubt my living situation. Brad/Tim/Anton seem to be not great influences in my life and I feel like living alone or with others would be better...but I’m not sure, it’s a ton of fun here and it is pretty awesome. Maybe the problem is just with me.

Well life’s at an interesting place now. I’ve started my masters degree and it seems to be helping my emotional state. I still have days where I’m really depressed and don’t want to do anything, but it seems to happen less and less. I find when I’m distracted with school or other things - I’m happier - but when I get time to think about all the productive things I could be doing - I start hating myself.

I’ve gotten better at catching myself being harsh on myself. I’ve allowed myself to be more ok with not living a perfect life. I still smoke a fuck ton, still in the mornings- sometimes even after class and always after work - though I don’t hate myself for it as much anymore.

Meditation has started to bring some benefits to my life. I really feel the stillness and clarity from a nice session. School is also helping me have a better outlook of myself. I’m still not talking to ANYONE...once a month I’ll message Shraddha but I don’t think she’s interested. I’m not sure though. In a weird way, I care significantly less about hookups. I surely want a relationship but I think I’m starting to see the fact that I need to genuinely like the girl if I want to date her. Not this obsessive-like behavior I’ve done with every girl in the past that I thought I “liked”.

Looks like I’m going to either live alone next term, or live with Jayme - I would prefer the latter. I’m a bit scared about living alone as I think there’s a chance it’ll put me in an isolationist depression-like mood. On the other hand, it could be very relaxing and just what I need - I have no idea.

I went on vacation at the end of April to Mexico. It was also interesting. Near the end, I just wanted it to end. I still remember going home at around 8pm some nights and just sleeping till the next day because I didn’t want to do anything or meet anyone. It was so odd….

I’m in a weird place where I’m not sure whether I’m extremely comfortable being alone or extremely desperate for human interaction….I think I’m finally getting over Mia, though still a soft spot for her. I go out clubbing alone to meet girls, but then it seems like I just want sex from them...maybe it’s because I haven’t met the right girl?

Overall I think I’m happier than before - and it seems to be gradually getting better...even with some rough days in between.

May 21st, 2016
So today is Saturday. It was a long weekend, we have monday off. I don’t have weed anymore and smoked some of antons kief. No dealers in waterloo either, so i only have antons supply...which could last me - but i’m trying so hard to not smoke right now. I put it off till 4pm, but then caved in. I cried, i felt really bad about it. I honestly don’t know if I’ll do it again. 

Trying to develop will power is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I can’t manage to quit smoking weed and in a sense I genuinely don’t know who I am. I’m studying AI, a software developer and working out...do I even enjoy any of these? I shouldn’t have to question myself here, but I do because I feel like once I quit smoking weed - I’ll be a different person? I don’t even know, this barely makes sense.

So….it's been awhile since I’ve written in here. I find this is one place I can just be honest with myself. Life has been really up and down recently. I started seeing a therapist for my weed issues and it’s been helping. He’s helped me figure out how to be happy ‘in the moment’. I still smoke way too much weed, before work, after work, all day, sometimes even during work...but it’s been getting better? I think this is the first time since I got addicted that I don’t feel that craving for it. I’m not sure why, a lot of it must have something to do with just accepting myself for who i am.

I’ve set the plan to graduate by aug 2018 (full time BB till apr 2018 and part time till aug 2018). Then hopefully travel the world for 4 months, come back and work in California for 3-4years. Find a wife, move back to Canada. Get married, start a business in education, raise a family and die. This seems doable but the business is ambitious, maybe start planning it now so I have some ideas.

Dec 18th, 2016
So today is the first day I actually wrote something down about this idea to start an ai tutoring company. I've been thinking about for a few weeks now...and the idea has stuck around so I thought I'd write down a mission statement and what not. I considered doing a PhD in ITS but am turned off by the idea of so much for so little financial gain. The company has the chance to change the world and make a lot of money...win/win.

It seems to have me motivated enough that I don't really want to smoke as much anymore. I've told myself I'm going to take a break from Dec 24th to Feb 1st. Just to see how living life without weed is like. This company idea seems to be interesting enough to divert my attention from smoking.

I'm still pretty lonely..I think? I guess I don't really care that much anymore. Recently talked to shraddha on the phone which was fun. Saw Mia the other day at their 4th annual Elgin street party and we seemed to get along...I think she thinks highly of me and I hope we can eventually be friends...and I think for the first time I can say...that's all I really want from her....I think....lol.

Work is starting to get enjoyable as well. I am a custom to my job and the ai project is pretty neat.

Well I just got my mark for neuroanatomy back and it was a 68, which means I need to write a petition or something as I was required to get a 73 (or 78?) in my first 2 courses. The structures in place for masters students seem less formal so there's a chance this probation status will simply be overlooked.

Labeeb got our parents watches as today is their anniversary. Family relationships seem to be very healthy, dad seems to be happier now as well. I think a lot of my “care” was from 

Emotionally speaking...I feel like I’m getting better. Trying to go this next month without smoking weed...let’s see how it goes.

Well i didn’t stop smoking at all in January or February but I feel much better these days. As a result I am smoking a lot less. I also seem to have some serious coughing problem when I smoke and my throat hurts like a bitch so I have been smoking less for that reason as well. I’m also seeing it’s actually affecting my memory and my connection to the world in a very negative way. 

I’ve recently completed a timeline which plans out my entire life and it seems to be very enlightening. To be able to just look at my life in the biggest of pictures is rather satisfying and humbling. Work is going well, family is well, friend relationships are healthy as well. I’m not sure but it seems like the reason I was smoking so much weed was because it calmed the anxiety that came from not having an answer to the question “What am I doing with my life?”, but with this timeline - it seems like I’ve answered that question contently. At least that’s my answer for why I’ve been smoking less. I’ve realized how ‘collective’ I am and how much I derive my happiness from other people. I just need to put myself in environments where I can maximize that.

I’ve started putting $1,200/month to OSAP and am really trying to pay off debt fast now. The goal is to be out of debt by August next year.

Mia messed me yesterday saying how she wanted to turn to me for CS help as it was looking rough. This made me feel so good, I think all I wanted this time was to be on good terms with her. I felt she was one of the few people who understood just how nice I was and I was desperate for her to know that it wasn’t because I had feelings for her. Her messaging me showed me that and it felt amazing. 

Shraddha has also commented on how I’m the nicest person she’s ever met. I am aware that I’m much nicer to girls I’m interested in but for good reason. I want them to know who I am better than other people. I have others tell me I’m very kind as well, but the people whom  I want to know that the most are girls I’m interested in. All in all, life is looking really good emotionally speaking.

I’ve started playing Poker at woodbine a LOT. I’ve gone for the past 7 days in a row and I might be addicted. I’m making pretty good money from it right now so the possibility of this happening as a career or a side job seems realistic. It’s also a ton of fun and I think it may be the reason I’m smoking less. I’ve finally found something I enjoy that I can do on my spare time...and the added bonus that it has a great profit is extra enjoyable...perhaps a bit addicting….although it could also just be my personality.

I’ve been coming into work at around 11:30am for the past 3 months and no one seems to care but I feel a bit guilty. I’m not doing nearly as much work as I should be and I’m falling behind on some key projects. The affective computing course is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen academically. It is literally trying to explain why humans act and have emotions….from a mathematical perspective!! The project I’m doing also seems very interesting. 

I’m still not the person I “want” to be but I’m definitely getting there. Life is slowly falling in place the way I want, just a few more obstacles to overcome...such as working out and being kind/empathetic again.

Well today is st. patties and life is looking pretty damn good. I just submitted my ethics application for the research I’m doing for CS886. Everything seems to be in place and I’m slowly smoking less and developing motivation to do stuff. School is going well, work is going well, friendships are healthy, just got 10k back in tax returns and poker seems to be going well. 

The life timeline I completed a while ago is really coming together and I feel like I can really relate to it. If my life goes as I’ve described there then I think I’ll be pretty happy...and it does seem realistic. Finances seem  to be the only major concern but hopefully Poker can help with that. The goal is to be out of debt by end of next year but if I quit work by August and plan to go on vacation for 4 months afterwards...there is a chance I won’t be able to, but we’ll see.

So I got a 96 in my Affective Computing course and my prof wants to hire me over the summer to try and submit the paper for publication. Seems like a wonderful opportunity, makes me believe in my academic competencies and that I can actually compare against some of these very talented UW grad students. I’m also out of probation which is a huge relief. Makes me pretty confident that I will be able to graduate successfully. If I’m able to take 2 courses per term for the remainder of my degree- I’ll be able to graduate in April 2018. Otherwise I’ll have to take 1,1,1,3 and graduate in August 2018. 

I also managed to wake up at 7:45 today and come into work at 8:45, before everyone else. It’s the first day of the new semester and it’s critical I get it off to a good start. Been learning a ton about the history of AI/ML over this past month and it’s been pretty awesome. Seems like a lot of potential opportunities ahead. I’m taking Neural Networks and Deep Learning this term which seem really interesting.

Overall, things are looking pretty up. My timeline is getting honed to my specific interests and I’m starting to see where AI fits into the big picture. If this next year goes according to plan - I set myself up for a good start to 2019.
